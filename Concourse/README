CONCOURSE

Concourse is a schemaless database that is designed for applications that
have large amounts of sparse data in read and write heavy environments.
Concourse comes with automatic indexing, data versioning and support for
ACID transactions.

Concourse aims to be a service that is easy for developers to deploy, access
and scale with minimal tuning, while also being highly optimized for fast
read/write operations. With Concourse there is no need to declare any
structure up front--no schema, no tables, no keyspaces, no indexes, no column
families, etc. Instead, you simply write any distinct value to any column
in any row at any time and the necessary structure is created for you on
demand.
