KONCOURSE
===========
Koncourse is a data store for PHP applications that is based on the entity-attribute-value with classes and relationships (EAV/CR) model. Koncourse enables rapid development of applications that

* have sparse and heterogenous data,
* have large numbers of classes and class instances, or
* have dynamic ontologies.

This framework also includes utilities for many useful operations that are not in the PHP standard library.
