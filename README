CONCOURSE

Concourse is a schemaless distributed version control database with
serializable transactions and full-text search. Concourse provides a more
intuitive approach to data management that is easy to deploy, access and
scale with minimal tuning while also maintaining the referential integrity,
atomicity, consistency, isolability and durability found in traditional
database systems.
