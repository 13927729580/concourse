# Concourse

[Concourse](http://cinchapi.org/concourse) is a schemaless and distributed version control database with optimistic availability, serializable transactions and full-text search. Concourse provides a more intuitive approach to data management that is easy to deploy, access and scale with minimal tuning while also maintaining the referential integrity and ACID characteristics of traditional database systems.

**This README is written for developers looking to contribute to the codebase. Detailed user documentation is available at [http://cinchapi.org/concourse](http://cinchapi.org/concourse)**

## General Information

### Versioning

This is version 0.2.0 of Concourse.

Concourse will be maintained under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
guidelines such that release versions will be formatted as `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
where

* breaking backward compatibility bumps the major,
* new additions while maintaining backward compatibility bumps the minor, and
* bug fixes or miscellaneous changes bumps the patch.

### Modules
This repository contains several modules that form the concourse-core.

* The **concourse-api** project contains the core API, which is the foundation for everything in Concourse. This API is public and should be used in third-party applications to interact with Concourse.
* The **concourse-server** project contains all the server-side logic for data storage and retrieval. You should __*never*__ include this code in a third-party application, but should install the concourse-server distribution and interact with it using the concourse-api.
* The **concourse-shell** project contains the code for the Concourse Action SHell (CaSH), which is shipped with concourse-server.
* The **concourse-testing** project contains long running end-to-end tests that should be run separately from the build process.

Always check that Concourse builds properly after you've made changes. We use [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) as the build system.

	$ ./gradlew clean build distZip
	
If all goes well, unzip the distribution in `concourse-server/build/distribution`, launch CaSH and sanity check some [smoke tests](https://cinchapi.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CON/Testing+Zone).
